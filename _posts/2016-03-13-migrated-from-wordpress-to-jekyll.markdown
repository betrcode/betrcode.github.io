Some of the old blog posts have been pruned.

Please note that I rarely write blog posts, but when I do I mostly do it on: [http://blog.crisp.se/author/maxwenzin](http://blog.crisp.se/author/maxwenzin).

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyllâ€™s GitHub repo][jekyll-gh]. If you have questions, you can ask them on [Jekyll Talk][jekyll-talk].
