One of the many tools at disposal and a reference to the company name (Better Code) is The Joel Test. I keep it here to remind myself of the simple prerequisites of successful software development!

## The Joel Test

* Do you use source control?
* Can you make a build in one step?
* Do you make daily builds?
* Do you have a bug database?
* Do you fix bugs before writing new code?
* Do you have an up-to-date schedule?
* Do you have a spec?
* Do programmers have quiet working conditions?
* Do you use the best tools money can buy?
* Do you have testers?
* Do new candidates write code during their interview?
* Do you do hallway usability testing?


I keep this list here to always keep it in mind! For the full article, see [The Joel Test](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000043.html)
